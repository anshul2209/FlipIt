This extension helps in conversion of the prices displayed on the amazon.com store (Dollars) in the regional format of India ie Rupees. It would be helpful for someone who is comparing the prices in USA and India.

The price conversion is in real time by tracking the currency rates on the foreign exchange.

Disclaimer: This is a hobby tool I created to compare prices of different product I wish to purchase and also because the default currency converter on the amazon web store USA doesn't show all the prices in INR.
